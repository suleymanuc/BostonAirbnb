# BostonAirbnb

In this project, I will investigate the AirBnB Boston Data to understand the relationship between the listing price and customer satisfaction and the listing neighborhoods.
In this project, the following questions will be answered:
1) How much the listing prices fluctuates through a year? In this section, I will obtain the busiest time in Boston and find out how much the listing prices increase at this time.
2) How do the listing prices varies for different neighborhoods?
3) After removing the seasonal price increase, how is the customer satisfaction related to the listing price? Do higher paying customers tend to expect more from their stay? Do customers correlate the price difference between different neighborhoods and have the similar satisfaction with lower priced listings?

I will detect the distinctive words used in the listing descriptions and reviews, such as "nice neighborhood" or "great location" to distinguish the satisfaction resulted from the neighborhood rather than the listing price.
